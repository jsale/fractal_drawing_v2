## üõ†Ô∏è Controls Overview

### Shape Tab

This is your main control center for selecting a drawing tool and adjusting its properties. Each mode has a unique set of parameters.

  * **Tree**: Control recursion levels, length, angle, width, and randomness.
  * **Fern**: Set the number of points and overall size for the classic Barnsley fern.
  * **Path/Eraser**: Control the stroke width.
  * **Other Modes**: Each generative shape like Snowflake, Flower, and Vine has its own iterative and aesthetic controls.

### Color Tab

Manage all color-related properties here.

  * **Branch/Palette Colors**: The color pickers dynamically update based on the number of "Branch levels" set in the Shape tab. These colors are used for Trees and as a palette for other modes.
  * **Object Alpha**: Set a global transparency for newly drawn objects.
  * **Editing Levels**: In **Tree** mode, click on any branch on the canvas to select its "level." You can then edit the color and alpha for that specific level on all trees, or just the selected one.
  * **Background Color**: Set the background color for the entire scene.

### Presets Tab

Quickly apply a professionally designed color palette to your scene. Selecting a preset will instantly update the colors in your **Color** tab.

### History Tab

Track your creative process and manage your session data.

  * **Undo/Redo**: Step backward or forward through your actions.
  * **Playback**: Watch a replay of your entire drawing process from the beginning.
  * **Export Session**: Saves the entire state of your application‚Äîincluding the full undo/redo history‚Äîinto a single `.json` file.
  * **Load Session**: Load a previously exported `.json` file to restore your session exactly where you left off.
